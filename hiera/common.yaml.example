# This is an example of the kinds of things that you can configure via hiera.
# If you've left the defaults in `/hiera.yml`, you might want to copy this file
# to `hiera/common.yaml`, or feel free to start with a blank slate!

# Have a gander at some of these examples to get an idea of some of the things
# that you can affect 'out of the box', and then customise to your
# heart's content.
