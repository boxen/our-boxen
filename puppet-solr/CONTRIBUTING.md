Thanks for contributing to Boxen! A couple of notes to help you out:

* We're conservative with version bumps, especially on services. We
  tend to keep things aligned with what we're personally using in
  development. If that doesn't work for your team, fork the module and
  use it in your Boxen instead.

* Otherwise, go crazy! Fork it, fix it, test it, pull request it.
  Remember that a PR is the start of a conversation, not the end of one.

:heart:,
Boxen
