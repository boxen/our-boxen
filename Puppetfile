# This file manages Puppet module dependencies.
#
# It works a lot like Bundler. We provide some core modules by
# default. This ensures at least the ability to construct a basic
# environment.

# Includes many of our custom types and providers, as well as global
# config. Required.

# Core modules for a basic development environment.
# You can replace some/most of those if you want, but it's not recommended.
